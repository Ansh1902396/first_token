# Simple CW20 Token

This smart contract was written for making a simple token on the Oraichain Testnet.
You can find the documentation here: ![Oraichain Docs](https://docs.oraichaindao.org/)

I have named the token SmartyPantz (SYPZ) and it has been deployed.
You can add the token using OWallet or on Keplr using this contract address: orai1q9thmpmaqm0f8flccdmelhnwzkz5ueax46vyauxqz0ys73yrvf5ssluvnu
