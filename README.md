Simple token using cw20

This smart contract was written for making a simple token on the Oraichain Testnet. 
I have named the token Lakshya-token (LKT) and it has been deployed. You can add the token using OWallet or on Keplr using this contract address: orai1r9y0auvg47rnr4m9u28h5a6qgxzjnujw8s53hpe989lv3aq8yydqxv82dm
